## What is SDMX.NET? ##

SDMX is a large and complex standard which makes creating SDMX-capable applications a difficult and error-prone activity. Using an SDMX specific library, which is an accurate implementation of the standard, will enable developers to create robust and production ready SDMX applications. **SDMX.NET** is that library.â€¬

  * Completely open source.
  * Produce and consume SDMX from any data source (like Excel or Database).
  * Accurate implementation of the supported SDMX artefacts.
  * Written in C# and thus compatible with any .NET application.
  * Intuitive and easy to use API.
  * Optimized for scalability and performance.

## Examples ##
To give an idea of what the framework can accomplish, here is a code sample in **C#** for inserting an SDMX file into the database. It is important to note that the library ensures that the resulting dataset is 100% valid based on the key family definition.
```
// load the structure definition
var structure = StructureMessage.Load("StructureSample.xml");
var keyFamily = structure.KeyFamilies[0];

// create IDataReader from the data file
using (var reader = DataReader.Create("GenericSample.xml", keyFamily))
{
    // use bulk insert into the database
    using (var bulkCopy = new SqlBulkCopy("connection string"))
    {                   
         bulkCopy.DestinationTableName = "TargetTableName";
         bulkCopy.WriteToServer(reader);
    }
}
```

The `DataReader` created implements the `IDataReader` interface and thus can be used like an ADO.NET `DataReader` that is familiar to .NET programmers.

The following example shows how to create a new code list and save it to a file.

```
var codelist = new CodeList(new InternationalString("en", "Countries"), "CL_COUNTRY", "UIS");

var code = new Code("CAN");
code.Description["en"] = "Canada";
codelist.Add(code);

code = new Code("USA");
code.Description["en"] = "United States of America";
codelist.Add(code);

var message = new StructureMessage();
message.Header = new Header("MSD_HDR", new Party("UIS")) { Prepared = DateTime.Now };            
message.CodeLists.Add(codelist);
message.Save("CL_COUNTRY.xml");
```

Of course, the framework has many other capabilities like creating other SDMX artefacts and converting between the different data formats.
